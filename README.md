# PyDichotomy
A script that splits a group of items into two based on certain restrictions defined in a dictionary.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
A group of individuals want to go for a road trip using two vans but there are grudges amongst them. People with a grudge cannot be in the same van.
The grudge_list is a dictionary with the keys being every individual and value being a list of people an individual has a grudge with.
If it is impossible for all the individuals to board the vans and still be in the same van with people they dont have grudges with, the road trip will be cancelled.
